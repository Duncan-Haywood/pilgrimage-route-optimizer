# Security Checklist for Public Repository

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Tasks

### 1. **Removed Hardcoded Secrets**
- [x] Replaced hardcoded `secret_key_base` in `config/dev.exs` with environment variable
- [x] Replaced hardcoded `secret_key_base` in `config/test.exs` with environment variable
- [x] Replaced hardcoded database passwords with environment variables

### 2. **Environment Configuration**
- [x] Created `.env.example` file with example values
- [x] Added `.env` files to `.gitignore`
- [x] Documented environment variables in README

### 3. **Git History Check**
- [x] Searched git history for sensitive data
- [x] Found hardcoded secrets in previous commits

### 4. **Documentation**
- [x] Improved README with comprehensive documentation
- [x] Added security section to README
- [x] Created MIT LICENSE file
- [x] Removed any PII or sensitive information from documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Git History Contains Secrets
The git history still contains the old hardcoded secrets from previous commits. Since these were example/development secrets, they're not critical, but you should be aware.

**Options to clean git history:**
1. **If the repository is not yet public**: Consider using `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove sensitive data from history
2. **If you're okay with the history**: The secrets were development-only and have been changed

### Before Going Public

1. **Rotate all secrets**: Generate new secret keys even if the old ones were only for development
2. **Review dependencies**: Run `mix deps.audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
3. **Double-check environment**: Ensure no `.env` file is committed
4. **Set up branch protection**: Protect main branch and require PR reviews

### Recommended Commands

```bash
# Generate new secret key
mix phx.gen.secret

# Check for any remaining secrets in current files
grep -r -i -E "(api[_-]?key|secret|password|token)" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=_build --exclude-dir=deps --exclude=".env*"

# Audit dependencies (if mix_audit is installed)
mix deps.audit
```

## üìã Final Checklist

- [ ] All secrets moved to environment variables
- [ ] `.env.example` file created with documentation
- [ ] `.gitignore` updated to exclude `.env` files
- [ ] README improved with setup instructions
- [ ] LICENSE file added
- [ ] No PII or sensitive data in current codebase
- [ ] Ready to make repository public

## üîí Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. Never commit `.env` files
2. Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
3. Regularly update dependencies
4. Use GitHub's security features (Dependabot, secret scanning)
5. Set up CI/CD with security checks
